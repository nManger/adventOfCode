# adventOfCode

These are my personal solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) advent calendar. 

I try using a different language every year. This year I will be using C++.

Previous years:
- [2021](https://github.com/nManger/adventOfCode/tree/2021) in Julia using Jupyter notebooks.
- [2020](https://github.com/nManger/adventOfCode/tree/2020) in C# using Visual Studio.
